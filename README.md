# Parallelization of local and global mesh operations on Scotty3D

This website will host information about Alan Lee and Shilin Ma's F23 15418 final project on mesh operation parallelization.

The project proposal can be found [here](project_proposal.pdf).

The milestone report can be found [here](project_milestone.pdf).

# Schedule
